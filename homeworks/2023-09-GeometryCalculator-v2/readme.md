# Ellipse

## Repeat, Repeat, Repeat

Congratulation! If you made it so far, you worked you way through the basics of classes. If you did not fully understand everything we discussed in class, rewatch the video, follow along with the samples. It is important that you understand the concept of classes and objects!

## Add the Ellipse Class

At the end of the video, we have classes for circles, rectangles, and triangles. Now, it is your turn to add a class for ellipses. The class should have the following properties:

* Longest radius
* Shortest radius

The area of an ellipse is calculated as follows:

$$ A=πab $$

where _a_ and _b_ are the longest and shortest radius, respectively.

In analogy to the other classes, _a'_ and _b'_ are calculated as follows:

$$ a' = \sqrt{f} a $$

$$ b' = \sqrt{f} b $$
